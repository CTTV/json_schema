Release 1.2.2
-------------
We have introduced some changes to the schema that are described below. The new schema version is 1.2.2. 
These changes affects:
- EVA and COSMIC somatic mutation evidence submission mainly (see 1.)
- Affected pathways information when mutations are also exported (see 1.)
- We introduced some recommendation for the data providers to follow (see 2.)

1.	The evidence part of the schema has changed for EVA and COSMIC to allow for submission of mutations with new information.
The literature_curated schema has changed with known_mutations being now an array of mutations. 
This field is not mandatory so it should not affect other submitters except affected pathway providers like REACTOME
https://github.com/CTTV/json_schema/blob/master/src/evidence/literature_curated.json
The mutation schema is located in:
https://github.com/CTTV/json_schema/blob/master/src/evidence/mutation/mutation.json
It harmonises EVA somatic mutations from ClinVar, somatic mutation types from COSMIC and mutation nomenclature 
from REACTOME affected pathways.
There are 2 mandatory fields: preferred_name and functional_consequence. 
When the functional_consequence is unknown, the SO term sequence_alteration should be used (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SO:0001059).
REACTOME will have a preferred name for the mutation like “[JAK2 V617F]”. 
For EVA, since we can’t rely on the HGVS sequence variant description yet, the preferred name will be the mutation type.

2.	Literature references. We introduced a recommendation for the data providers to follow regarding the submission of literature references.
There is a now a field called literature in the schema at the same level as target, disease and evidence.
https://github.com/CTTV/json_schema/blob/master/src/base.json

We introduced this field in the schema as a way for us to index the literature references across all data sources.
This will help us to aggregate evidence per publication. Especially when we have several time the same publication referenced from text mining, manual curation and databases.
The literature field is equivalent to the one already used in the evidence part of the schema (if you have pubmed/epmc references).
Thus, it’s a duplication of the existing list of publication references in the provenance_type field but exposed at a higher level in the evidence string.
Please, use PMID when possible so we can index all the information the same way.
Below is an example of a set of literature references from REACTOME exposed at a higher level:

{
...
  “target”: {...},
“disease”:{...},
“evidence”: {...}, => keep your literature reference in this part of the schema as you did last time. There is no change here 
  "literature": {
       "references": [
         {
           "lit_id": "http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23664117"
         },
         {
           "lit_id": "http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23664118"
         },
         {
           "lit_id": "http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/10506123"
         }
       ]
     }
}
